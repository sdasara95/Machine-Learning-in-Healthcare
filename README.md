# Machine Learning in Healthcare

## Project Overview <br>
This serves as a tutorial on how to apply machine learning for regression and classification applications using healthcare data. <br>
This project comprises of two tasks. <br>
**Task 1** <br>
This task involves the estimation of length of stay using a subset of MIMIC III data. <br>
The derived subset is *task1.csv* <br>
This is a regression problem <br>
**Task 2** <br>
This task involves the prediction of hospital readmission for diabetic patients. <br>
The data used is derived from *Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 Data Set* <br>
The derived subset is *task2.csv* <br>
This is a classification problem <br>

## Environment Setup  <br>
Refer ***ML_tutorial.pdf*** to set up the environment for this tutorial.  <br>

## Code  <br>
The notebook : ***ML_tutorial.ipynb*** contains all the code.  <br>
